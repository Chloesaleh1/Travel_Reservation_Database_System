# Travel-Reservation-Database-System

This project involves designing and developing a travel reservations system for a third-party agency. The system will manage flights and hotel/AirBnB bookings, handle payments, and store customer and admin accounts with unique identifiers. Features include tracking total income for property owners, storing credit card and location details of customers, managing flight details including airlines, capacity, and ticket costs, and handling property bookings with details on amenities, cost, and owner information. The system will also support rating and reviewing customers, owners, and properties.

The following Schema is the finalized version of our database design:
